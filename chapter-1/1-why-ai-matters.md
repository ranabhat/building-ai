# Why AI Matters 

Artificial Intelligence or at least "narrow AI" (AI that handles only one task) is already a part of our lives.

Few examples where we rely on AI methods:
> 1. Search online
> 2. Use of smartphone to take and edit a picture
> 3. Ask siri or Alexa for recommendation
> 4. Use GPS for navigation


#### What AI looks like in real life

Real life cases :
> 1. Content Recommendation (for instance, tv shows or movie recommendation in Netflix, music recommendation in Spotify)
> 2. Online Shopping 
> 3. Online Support
> 4. Waste Sorting
> 5. Resource Mapping
> 6. Your AI idea ?
